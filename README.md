# How to compute PIT positions:

  - Scan weld seam.
  - Place weld_seam_scan.txt (name irrelevant) into 'scans/before/unprocessed/'
  - Edit program.py, line 30, change FILE_NAME = "weld_seam_scan"      .... Notice there is no file extension.
  - in terminal run: "python3 program.py"
  - Trajectory files are located in 'trajectories/' named weld_seam_scan-trajectory-0.txt and weld_seam_scan-trajectory-1.txt
